FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
 To start Group Server:
 >java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username and a password. This name becomes the first user and is a
 member of the ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The group server will by
 default run on port 8765, but a custom port can be passed as the first command
 line argument.
 
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.

 To start a File Server:
 >java RunFileServer [port number] [Group Server address] [Group Server port]
 To authenticate tokens, a file server needs the Group Server's public key, so
 we set it up so that it will call the Group Server when launched to retrieve
 the key. Thus, it needs the address and port of the Group Server. The file
 server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one does not
 exist. The file server is now online.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 
 Note that this implementation supports server side directories.
 
 To start using the Secure File Sharing application, launch the MainUI:
 >java MainUI
 You get a menu to login or exit. After login, follow menus to an appropriate
 server. All menu selections are done via integer input. Illegal operations
 are not allowed and user will be warned.
