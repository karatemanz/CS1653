\section{Section 2: Security Requirements}
\subsection{General Properties of Secure File Sharing}
A bulleted list of properties that should apply to \emph{any} such file sharing system.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Property 1: Correctness.} Correctness implies that if file \emph{f} is shared with members of group \emph{g}, only members of group {g} should be able to access \emph{f}. The notion of ``access” entails the creation, modification, and deletion of \emph{f}, as well as the ability to see that \emph{f} even exists. Without this requirement, any user could access any file, which is contrary to the notion of group-based file sharing.
\item open verified software
\item user verification
\item strong login protocols
\item physical system protections
\item connection restrictions
\item user roles
\item permission levels
\item correctness
\item password integrity (and authentication)
\item user/group uniqueness
\item filename uniqueness
\item file integrity
\item file restrictions
\item download integrity
\end{itemize}
\subsection{System Assumptions \& Threat Models}
A paragraph informally describing the trust assumptions that you are making regarding the players in the system. This could, for example, be a description of the system model in which you envision your application being deployed.
\begin{itemize}
\item A
\item B
\item C
\end{itemize}
